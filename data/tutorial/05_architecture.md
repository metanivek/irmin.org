Two types of stores are used in Irmin: the **block** and the **reference**
store.

### The block store

This is the type of store used for the _commits_, _nodes_ and _contents_. The
block store is **persistent** and **content addressable**. **Persistence** means
that updating a data structure returns a new one, which shares its sub-parts as
much as possible with the original structure, to avoid the cost of extra
allocations. A side effect is that a history of updates is maintained as well.

It is also a **content addressable** store as _values_ (be it contents, commits
or nodes) are stored as a pair `(hash(value), value)` and therefore a value can
be accessed using its hash.

A collection of block stores is available in Irmin, but you can create your own
using the interface [Irmin.Content_addressable.S] as long as the following
are guaranteed:

- reads using the same key return the same value.

- writes of the same value return the same key.

### The reference store

It is a mutable store, used for _branches_. As in Git, branches are tags added
to commits. A default branch is always available in Irmin, the `main`.
Branches are useful when multiple processes access the store, to keep track of
the state of each process. This type of store is also called an **atomic write**
store: two independent processes can do some local modifications, but updating
the same branch is an atomic and concurrent operation.

Branches are stored in the reference store as pairs of `(hash(commit), branch)`.

As for the block store, you can choose a reference store from the ones provided
by Irmin, or you can create your own using the interface
[Irmin.Atomic_write.S]. The operations you have to implement need to satisfy
some constraints:

- concurrent reads of the same branch name return the same hash. Updates of a
  branch name to a given commit should be sequentially consistent: subsequent
  reads of a branch name should always result in the last hash which has been
  written.

- writes are implemented using two operations. `set` updates a branch name to a
  given hash, but provides no guarantees in the case of concurrent writes.
  `test_and_set` is a two step operation: (1) it first checks what is the
  current hash of a branch name and (2) it then updates the branch name to a new
  hash. This two step operation needs to be atomic to guarantee that in case of
  concurrent writes only the _fastest_ write updates the branch name.

  Ensuring that `test_and_set` is atomic is usually not very easy to do, as the
  POSIX interface does not provide such an operation. [Irmin_fs_unix] uses a
  [dotlocking] optimistic strategy (using the fact that creating a file can be
  done atomically on POSIX filesystems).

### Combining the two

Commits, nodes, contents and branches stores combine in an Irmin store.

As we have seen in our examples so far, Irmin uses trees to store its contents:
the leaves of the tree contain the _contents_, while the _nodes_ encode the path
in the tree from the root to the contents. _Commits_ are represented as special
nodes in the tree. For instance, the contents we commited to a `Mem_store` in
the [Getting started](/tutorial/getting-started) section:

```ocaml
let main () =
    let* repo = Mem_store.Repo.v config in
    let* t = Mem_store.main repo in
    Mem_store.set_exn t ["a"; "b"; "c"] "Hello, Irmin!" ~info:(info "my first commit")
```

are represented as ![First commit](images/first.png)

We add a new commit:

```ocaml
let new_commit t =
    Mem_store.set_exn t ["d"] "Goodbye!" ~info:(info "my second commit")
```

and the store changes to

![Second commit](images/second.png)

The `main` branch references the latest commit.

As mentioned, Irmin has a few _types_ of stores available: the in-memory store
and the Git store that we have seen in section
[Getting started](/tutorial/getting-started), but also some others that you can
explore on [GitHub][github]. In the [next section](/tutorial/backend) we will
create our own Irmin stores.
